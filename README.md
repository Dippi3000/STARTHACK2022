# STARTHACK2022

## Introduction
EWOR is building the next challenge-driven learning environment that promotes autodidactic, data-driven movers and shakers. The education platform gives aspiring founders everything they need to become (even more) entrepreneurial, in order to design and deliver impactful innovations and ventures.

## The Challenge
Ensure that your solution is economically effective and efficient, supports social dimensions and is environmentally sustainable. We evaluate your solution based on the social, environmental and economic impact it has.

Resources:
To meet the evaluation criteria, these frameworks can be used. Consider these frameworks to develop your solution taking into account economic, social and sustainability dimensions.

Triple Bottom Line - People/Planet/Profit
In economics, the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) states that companies should commit to considering social and environmental issues as much as their profits. TBL theory holds that there is not just one bottom line, but three: profits, people, and the planet. A TBL seeks to measure the degree of a company's commitment to corporate social responsibility and its impact on the environment over time.

Desirability, Feasibility, Viability: The Sweet Spot for Innovation
The process of identifying the most critical underlying assumptions of your idea and translating those into early prototypes can feel overwhelming. To break down these tasks, it is often helpful to view prototyping through different lenses which forces you to think about your ideas and prototyping from multiple perspectives.

A desirable solution that the customer really needs.
A feasible solution that builds on strengths and operational capabilities.
An economical solution with a holistic, sustainable integrative project management model.

Judging Criteria
We evaluate the solution based on several areas:
- Economic: Your solution should have key performance indicators (KPIs), generate value, and critical business decisions should be carefully chosen.
- Social: The commitment to social areas should include all stakeholders (internal and external) of the solution .
- Sustainable: The solution is evaluated according to its environmental impact. A contribution to climate protection or efforts to reduce the CO2 footprint should be an integral part of the solution.
